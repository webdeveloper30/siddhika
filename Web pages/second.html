A working group was created in 1994 to work on HTML. This group was known as The Internet Engineering Task Force or IEFT. The team formed with the core premise that the web was to stay open. Time Berners-Lee may have described the first 18 tags. This team developed a larger number of new tags and attributes by 1995. It became possible to set background color and fonts. There was some opposition to this development because HTML was first meant to describe a document’s structure, not its style. During this time browser vendors from all around the world came together to standardize HTML. The IEFT wasn’t able to keep up with the speed at which the new developments were taking place.<br>

W3C released Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in 1996 for supporting layout and presentation. HTML code became

 (telling or showing about its content), and web accessibility improved. Flash was also developed at the same time and was initially restricted to use for simple layout necessary tools. Web designers soon found that CSS allowed them to go beyond what HTML enabled them to do. Later it developed to such a level that they could develop comprehensive websites on it.<br>

During the early phase, the styles mostly limited to a single CSS file. Syntactically Awesome Style sheets (SASS) first established in 2006. However, it took, even more, years before Object-Oriented CSS and other similar methodologies began playing a role in the web. It led to the creation of styles which could be re-used, scaled and maintained.<br>

There are many new methodologies like SUIT CSS or Block-Element-Modifier (BEM). But CSS continues to play a crucial role in web development. CSS variables and element queries are expected to be the future.<br>

<b> JavaScript </b>

<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="05">
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript consider as the cornerstones of web development. It is JavaScript that has undergone the most amounts of changes over the decades. It first created in 1995. Interestingly, JavaScript developed within a span of just ten days. Server-side JavaScript also designed the same year. Node emerged as the most popular server-side JavaScript and first introduced in 2009.<br>

Today, JavaScript is integral to web development and most web elements are based on it – from native apps to build tools and many other things in between. At the same time, JavaScript has been evolving at a fast rate every year.<br>
